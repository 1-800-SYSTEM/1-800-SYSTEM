> Hello. I am 1X4 Or Creation, I do not mind either one. Though i do prefer 1x1x1x1! Yes, I ship AdminVirus. No i do not see them as Related. I see them as enemies nor do i see 1x4 as ABUSIVE / ETC, I find them as enemies to lovers, Even if 1x4 is Shedletskys hate and malice. I do not see them as related, father and son, etc. I am Fourteen, And I am a RarePair shipper and MultiShipper.

> I am quite nice if you talk to me a bit more, However i'll be more on the serious side if you've never talked to me before. Because i can't really recognize people easily / Struggle with talking due to Generalized Anxiety Disorder. Do not force me to talk if i do not want to. I am non-verbal unless friend / close.
>
> Do not interact with me if i am on DNIUVC, Or i do not consider you close. I only find two people close to me, And it will be obvious who. I do not play favourites, I just get attached to people i hang out with alot ( 1+ months ) then ill allow you to int w me on DNIUC status, If i talk to you alot then yknow. That type of stuff.
>
> I do not wish to help you with your object limit. Please dont interact with me if you only wish to use my tier 3. I only let my friends use my tier 3.
