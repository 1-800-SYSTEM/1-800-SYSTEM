> > I use a pretty advanced screenreader that can glitch easily due to fonts, However Noli, Our headmate, Uses a typing quirk that he uses at times. I use a screenreader because i am half deaf and have trouble seeing in my right eye. Because i am formerly half blind with issues struggling to see in my eye that was blind. Do not use fonts near me or i will simply ignore you or tell you off. Yes, My screenreader is easily glitched. No, I do not cause a big issue over it. I just complain about font usage.

> I am quite nice if you talk to me a bit more, However i'll be more on the serious side if you've never talked to me before.
